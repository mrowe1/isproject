        <p>
            I love Cars, I love the way they look, the way they sound, and they way they feel. 
            I love the feeling of knowing the machine is only as good as you. I didn't start really getting into cars 
            until I turned 16, thats when it started to feel like something that I could spend thousands of hours doing 
            and have zero problem with it. I hope this page doesn't only show you skills I have learned with HTML and CSS 
            but I hope I can also show you why cars are so fascinating and beautiful to me.

                    <li>0-60 mph in 2.8 seconds</li>
                    <li>In my opinion the most beautiful car ever created, this thing is pristine engineering and the love of cars wrapped up into the most perfect machine I have ever seen. The way McLaren designed the shape of the car to direct the air through and around the body letting all 3075 lbs of perfection glide through the air is simply stunning.</li>

                    <li>McLaren just does it right, two similar but starkly different instances that validate the quality of their craft at McLaren. Extremely similar to the P1 in many of its specs yet comparing them is like comparing paintings by an artist.</li>

                    <li>My attratction to this car definitely comes from the after market scene, so many of these cars are customized by their buyers to be more personalized and look absolutely stunning.</li>

                    <li>0-60 in 1.99 seconds</li>
                    <li>The most beautiful thing about cars is there are so many ways to "do it right". The Model S being an electric car, is able to achieve a higher acceleration than gas cars. There are so many trade-offs for gas versus electric but either way the engineering and precision that goes into these cars is astounding. </li>

        <p>McLaren was founded by New Zealand race car designer, driver, engineer, and inventor Bruce McLaren in 1963. I find him inspiring because he lived and breathed cars, that was the thing he pursued and he made it work.</p>

<!-- From-scratch page:
This page must be created from a blank HTML file.
It can be about anything. Pick a hobby, or a passion, or something that fascinates you.
It must include the following as a demonstration of your ability to write HTML and CSS:
    An unordered list embedded in an ordered list (or the other way around)
    At least one image not from the Bootstrap theme (feel free to have many more)
    An embedded YouTube video 
        (we intentionally didn’t teach you this, so you would have to figure it out—good learning experience)
    An on-page anchor
    A custom background color or background image

You also need to link to (and apply) a stylesheet that you have created from scratch. 
This stylesheet should include:
    At least four style definitions (it is possible you will have many more than four styles)
    Styles that specify font color
    Styles that specify font family
    At least three divs for positioning and styling blocks of content in the HTML page
    A live and interactive embedded Tableau graph (not just a picture of one).
        This graph can be about anything. It doesn’t have to be a graph you created, although it certainly can be.
        A quick Google search will show you where to find cool Tableau visualizations.
    Navigation back to the professional-looking pages.
Your professional-looking pages do not need to link to the scratch page 
(but you will submit the url to your scratch page). 
This way you can use the professional side for whatever you want without 
worrying someone might find this scratch page… -->
