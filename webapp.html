<!-- 
A small web app created in collaboration with AI: 
Be creative. Here are some examples of what other students have done. 
    Riddle generator
    Joke generator
    Number guessing game
    Snake game
    Wordle clone
Keep in mind that the first three are fairly basic.

To merit full credit on an app like one of the first three, it would require you to creatively contribute 
(either in style or function) to what the AI comes up with to go beyond a basic app.

Try to keep the code for this app in a single page (e.g., styles, html, and scripts all on one page).
    This page should be accessible via a link from the scratch page.
Rarely will the AI get it right on the first attempt. Feel free to iterate and refine with the AI until
 it meets your expectations. You are also encouraged to edit the AI solution to be just how you want it. -->
